<Show a patch (diff) or a link to a commit made in your forked repository that shows the new/enhanced test>

The coverage has improved because every model type and empty input is tested.

1. Test for 'model_predictionâ€™
![Screenshot from 2024-06-27 18-45-17](https://github.com/RAF-Alp/sysidentpy108/assets/118909280/8e674490-a259-4d08-a73a-dc97c7cdbf80)

In the function, total of 4 branches are identified including 2 invisible else.

![Screenshot from 2024-06-27 18-45-58](https://github.com/RAF-Alp/sysidentpy108/assets/118909280/fb1de5c8-62fa-4cc1-af79-7e6952545a76)

In the original test tool, only 1 branch has been reached, so three more tests are added to test three other conditions. 
+ 'test_additional_test_1_with_NFIR()','test_additional_test_2_with_NAR()','test_additional_test_5_with_Unknown()' 

![Screenshot from 2024-06-27 18-47-00](https://github.com/RAF-Alp/sysidentpy108/assets/118909280/d035f1c7-5d8f-443d-a279-3d6749fbfed0)

As a result, it can fully cover all the branches.

2. Test for '_narmax_predict'

![Screenshot from 2024-06-27 18-49-29](https://github.com/RAF-Alp/sysidentpy108/assets/118909280/37d5af54-114a-4680-8e38-78820286e226)

In the function, a total of 6 branches are identified including 2 invisible else's.
In the original test tool, only 3 branches had been reached, so two more tests are added to test two other conditions. 

'test_additional_test_3_with_Insufficient_initial_conditions()',
'test_additional_test_4_with_X_none()'

As a result, it can fully cover all the branches.

Coverage is improved by 1 because I added an assert to cover X=None branch.  Test is modified.

Coverage is improved by 2 because it tests for verbose being true instead of false in the model. Test is modified

Improved the coverage by 2 because it tests split_data with a custom basis function where the ensemble is False and not Polynomial.

New test function added improves branch coverage by 2 because it checks for the model without the Y parameter. That accesses one branch and then it checks for X being of polynomial type.
