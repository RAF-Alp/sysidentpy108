 <paragraph index="320" node_type="writer">The first branch un-covered branch could only be reached if the fourier object of the fit method had a degree greater than one. The second un-covered branch could only be reached if the fourier object's boolean attribute ‘ensemble’ was True.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="321" node_type="writer">To reach these two branches and improve the coverage to 7/7 the “test_fit_degree_and_ensemble_branches” test was created which instantiates a fourier object with degree = 2 and ensemble = True and then the fit function is called with the object which enters both branches with the same test.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="322" node_type="writer">Finally three asserts are made to ensure the degree and ensemble were correctly set and that the final output of the fit method isnt None ensuring the function worked correctly with the given parameters.</paragraph>

 <paragraph index="332" node_type="writer">The coverage was improved from 3/5 branches reached (60%) to 5/5 branches (100%).</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="333" node_type="writer">The first branch un-covered branch could only be reached if the AILS object’s ‘static_gain’ boolean attribute was False. The second un-covered branch could only be reached if the AILS object's boolean attribute ‘static_function’ was False.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="334" node_type="writer">To reach these two branches and improve the coverage to 7/7 the two test functions were created. The first one (test_build_system_data_static_gain_False_branch()) instantiates an AILS object with ‘static_gain’ set to False and then the build_system_data function is called with the object which enters the first branch. When the branch is entered it returns [y] + [static_function], therefore, to ensure the test is correct we assert that [y] + [static_function] was returned.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="335" node_type="writer">The second function one (test_build_system_data_static_function_False_branch()) instantiates an AILS object with ‘static_function’ set to False and then the build_system_data function is called with the object which enters the second branch. When the branch is entered it returns [y] + [static_gain], therefore, to ensure the test is correct we assert that [y] + [static_gain] was returned.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="336" node_type="writer">Although both these test functions are similar, since both the un-covered branches both lead to return statements two separate functions had to be made.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="339" node_type="writer">### Overall</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="342" node_type="writer">## Statement of individual contributions</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="344" node_type="writer">Mike:</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="345" node_type="writer">I found several open-source Github repositories, counted the lines in them and put them together in a table for discussion. I created unit tests for two functions and a simple coverage tool. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="348" node_type="writer">Song:</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="349" node_type="writer">I improved the print coverage function with HTML code to increase the readability of the test result. My contribution is that I set up the discussion on the meeting plan and the decision on the project schedules. Also, working on two functions to improve the coverage and sharing my approach with colleagues, which might be applicable to other methods. </paragraph>
 <paragraph index="352" node_type="writer">Alpdeniz Sarici Hernandez:</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="353" node_type="writer">I made the print coverage function to incorporate the dictionary of branches. With this, we could all output the branches that needed testing in our chosen functions. Once we knew which branches needed to be covered we created tests using arranges, acts, and asserts. Once I reached 80% I created my pull request and merged it with our code. Additionally, I was responsible for helping organize meetings and also clear any doubts we had.</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="355" node_type="writer">Luc Lacombe:</paragraph>
 <paragraph index="356" node_type="writer">Besides working on my two functions and improving their coverage, my main contributions to the group were communication and help. I organized many of the online and in person meetings we had and I helped my groupmates with bugs and errors they were running into. For example I helped Alpdeniz fix an issue where many of his tests were failing due to the newest version of numpy not supporting int32 float type variables.</paragraph>
